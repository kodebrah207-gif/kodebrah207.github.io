<h2>Stamps Scholars Portfolio</h2>

<div class="portfolio-item">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My entire being is filled with sorrow and grief whenever I see people suffering from all sorts of diseases and conditions. After all, I know what it feels like: having to spend weeks in the hospital and having to go through a lot of procedures just to be made whole, while some of these treatments can only be a reprieve for others. These emotions and experiences have been my driving force in my desire to become a pharmacologist in the near future to conduct research into drug discovery and improvement; the various biological and chemical processes within the body; and to come up with creative, effective, and affordable ways to treat these diseases and ailments. Over the years, the various skills and opportunities I have received, such as adaptability, discipline, empathy, hard work, punctuality, versatility, time management, and sharp decision making, have played a part in shaping me into the person I am today.</p> 
</div>

<div class="portfolio-item">
<h3>Academics</h3>
<p>My academic journey has also played a pivotal role in preparing me for the task at hand. Through outstanding performances in subjects such as Biology, Chemistry, and Math, which I am currently doing for my Cambridge Advanced Level(A Level) curriculum, I have gained a firm foundation when it comes to understanding the requirements of my intended major: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Biology provides me with detailed knowledge about the processes that take place within the human body and the many biological molecules involved. In Chemistry, I study the composition of various compounds, their application in the health industry, and how to acquire important analytical skills. Mathematics sharpens my reasoning and problem-solving skills and enhances my creativity. I have gained important skills such as data interpretation and analysis, research skills, as well as practical skills needed in the laboratory. Along the way, I have won awards such as Honour Roll Awards and the award for Second Best in A Level Mathematics: a testament to the hard work, effort, discipline, and consistency exhibited along the way.</p>

<h3>Leadership & Service</h3>
<p>In August 2024, I took an internship with the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at the University of Ghana. I got the opportunity to separate and amplify DNA samples using gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction techniques. My internship gave me hands-on experience in the laboratory. </p>
<p>Outside my academics, as a prefect at my school, I help in planning and organizing school events. Also, I organize students to participate in various sporting activities held in school and motivate, prepare, and encourage my team members to win and do their best.  
As part of my prefectorial duties, I also train and prepare my house members in various sporting and academic disciplines to harness their talents and skills and achieve the best of results with them.</p>
<p>At my church, St. Thomas Aquinas Parish, Legon,  I am an altar server. I help the priests during Holy Mass and Holy Eucharist celebrations. I also help with cleaning of vessels, ironing of vestments and in clean-up activities organised by the church. Furthermore, I help in setting up the altar at the main parish and in the organisation of where the Sunday School children and animators have Mass.</p>
<p>I have also been a Master of Ceremonies for my church’s Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, which happened on the 21st of December, 2024. As part of my role, I made the guests aware of the various scheduled events and their appointed times.</p>
<p>Being a leader also means being able to help others overcome their challenges and achieve their goals. As part of my preparations towards the May/June 2026 Cambridge Advanced Level(A Level) Examinations, I have organised a study group where we hold each other accountable, share our daily progress, and come up with solutions to various questions while providing a detailed approach on how to solve certain questions. Sometimes, it can be difficult getting everyone to cooperate, but I always ensure that peace and focus prevails.</p>

<div class="portfolio-item">
<h3>Mercer Honors Program</h3>
<p>I really admire the Mercer Honors Program because of its mission to create, establish, and equip talented individuals with all the necessary skills and qualities required of future leaders in order to make revolutionary changes in our world by applying all that they have learnt in real-world scenarios and issues. </p>
<p>The Mercer Honors Program has the capacity to provide super-personalised experiences in the classroom and through its Mercer on Mission program, students have the opportunity to submerge themselves in the culture of other nations, learning their values and acquiring life-changing and life-shaping experiences. That is why I strongly believe that the Mercer Honors Program is a big step in becoming an individual of substance as I come across challenges and situations that require me to put everything I 
have learnt to perfect use. </p>
<p>The Mercer Honors Program will help me in forging strong connections with highly ambitious, goal-oriented, like-minded peers. Again, as part of the Honors Program, I will have the great privilege of being under the tutelage of major professors and Honors Staff who can help me with academic and research endeavours, as well as in choosing the best career path that will help in enhancing my growth as a future leader. Also, by being paired up with Honors students who have greater experience, I will learn more about their challenges at the start, how they overcame them, and how I too can find my feet and succeed as an Honors student. Furthermore, being part of the Honors Community is an opportunity to be duly recognised and acknowledged for great achievements through events such as football and basketball games; honors attendance at concerts, plays, and symposiums; credit for attending academic lectures; and a student achievement banquet.</p>
<p>The Mercer Honors Program also has an excellent and greatly structured curriculum that makes the program such a key part in achieving my goals. Within 4 years, I will be taking various Honors courses, such as the HON 114, which introduces first-year students to the skills necessary to be highly successful in college; HON 200, where students consider the ethics and responsibilities of service and leadership; HON 300, which provides the opportunity to explore the resources, processes, methods, and ethics involved in research; HON 400, during which students will develop their post-graduation plans, while considering the complicated issues of personal mission and vocation, among other such important courses.</p>
<p>Through the Mercer Honors Program, I will acquire numerous life-changing skills and values, including advanced research skills; deeper critical and analytical thinking; improved human relations and communication skills; additional time management skills; self- awareness and mindfulness; adaptability and flexibility; integrity; honesty; and love for humanity. These strongly align with my Christian values and the training I have received ever since I was born, making my potential experience as an Honors student worthwhile.</p>

<h3>Stamps Scholars Program</h3>
<p>Without a trace of doubt, I believe that being a Stamps scholar is the greatest thing that could happen to not only me, but also for everyone who aspires to be one. Being a Stamps Scholar means more than free tuition, fees, food, housing, and even the latest iPad: it means being among like-minded and highly ambitious scholars who ask themselves everyday, “How am I going to make a positive impact in my world?”. This is similar to the words of Lo-Hua Yuan , the 2012 Stamps Scholar for the University of Michigan. She said, “The Stamps Scholars Program is not just giving students a financial means to attend college, but cultivating a family of bright minds, challenging us to dream deep and wide, and helping us manifest these dreams.”</p>
<p>This prestigious program offers the opportunity to be part of something revolutionary in our world !</p>
<p>My mission is to one day come up with a cure for sickle cell disease, especially to reduce the burden of this disease on Africans, 
including those from my country Ghana. Many people where I come from are born with this trait, which can be passed on to their descendants. This especially bothers me because sickle cell usually results in lower life expectancy, frequent crises, reduced physical activity (since sickle cell patients become easily fatigued and drained), and selective disadvantages when it comes to choosing life partners.</p>
<p>I plan to return to Ghana after my undergraduate and postgraduate studies at Mercer University, taking to heart everything I have acquired from the Mercer Honors Program and the Stamps Scholars Program, to conduct revolutionary scientific research, come up with a strategic plan to significantly improve overall public health within Ghana and the Sub-Saharan region, and hopefully, come up with alternative cures to sickle cell disease that are economical and much more effective at combatting the disease. 
By mastering the basics and even the more advanced topics of my intended Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major, I would have developed my understanding of the structure and role of  biological molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, gene expression, as well as the various biochemical pathways in the body. </p>
<p>Moreover, the Mercer Honors Program will do more than consolidate these gains. Through the HON 300 and HON 400 courses, I will pick up skills from engaging in scientific investigations and high-level data analysis, as well as being able to come up with suitable predictions for experiments, and using data from these experiments to come up with plausible conclusions. </p>
<p>In addition, with the much needed help of faculty members and Honors staff, I intend to dive into haemoglobin structure and function, gene mutations, the genes that are involved in sickle cell, as well as the mechanisms involved during health complications that occur in sickle cell patients. This can be very helpful in determining specific target sites where potential drugs can act upon in the body, improving specificity and efficacy of these drugs.</p>
<p>The Mercer Honors Program is also a key ingredient in making this plan bear fruit because through the HON 200 course, there is a great deal of knowledge to tap into as well as the many opportunities to apply ways to be ethically responsible and make a profound impact on society. Addressing the various challenges along the way requires being a team player, communicating with others clearly and respectfully, being there to offer support and advice to my colleagues and friends, and also showing resilience in the face of adversity . </p>
<p>The Stamps Scholarship is more than a big boost in making my wildest dreams and ambitions a reality through the Enrichment Fund of $16,000.00. Over the years, many Stamps Scholars have used their Enrichment Fund wisely to aid in their academic and professional development by conducting scientific research, attending study abroad experiences and conferences, and even being part of volunteering programs. I am determined to follow 
suit by allocating my Enrichment Fund towards career-shaping experiences such as biomedical research programs, global health conferences, internships, and collaborative research experiences. </p>
<p>Places where I believe it would be possible to gain such experience include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) and the National Institutes of Health(NIH), which holds a Summer Internship Program(SIP). Through their summer research internships and other similar programs that they undertake, I will be able to go through the doors of opportunity and enter the world of clinical and multi-institutional research. These programs also specialise in patient care since I will have the opportunity to interact with patients and hear from them about their problems.</p>
<p>Attending global health conferences will be eye-opening as I widen my insight into the many discoveries and breakthroughs that have already been made such as the use of CRISPR-Cas 9 technology and hydroxyurea treatment, while being among renowned scientists and health professionals, and it also helps in establishing connections with researchers such as Professor Solomon Fiifi Ofori-Acquah, an accomplished Ghanaian researcher in genetics and sickle cell disease who is currently heading the Georgia Solve Sickle Cell Initiative. These experts can mentor me and offer me advice during my studies and future endeavours. Furthermore, these conferences develop the capacity to produce interdisciplinary ideas and offer the avenue to present my research findings.</p>
<p>Moreover, being alongside other Stamps Scholars and Honors students offers a constant source of motivation, discipline, and ambition in achieving my goals and mission by working together to come up with brilliant ideas and solutions; sharing our experiences and aspirations; and engaging in liberal learning, professional knowledge, discovery, service to humankind, and community.</p>

<h3>Life after Mercer: Back to Ghana</h3>
<p>As stated earlier, I plan to return to my homeland Ghana to contribute meaningfully to ground-breaking scientific research 
after my time at Mercer. By the end of my PhD program, I hope to be competent as a researcher who can work independently, a disciplined laboratory leader, and an expert of the highest order in my field of study. 
More importantly, I believe that I would have gone far in finding a cure to the 
sickle cell disease.</p>
<p>I hope to play research roles in institutions such as the West African Genetic Medicine Centre in the University of Ghana, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research and the Sickle Cell Foundation of Ghana. This will provide me with credible institutional backing as I make contributions to clinical and translational research. Having affiliations with such institutions will be of great benefit to all parties involved  as I play active roles in community engagement and educating the general public. Also, working in such institutions will strengthen my foundations in molecular biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology, adding to the skills I would have acquired at Mercer University. </p>
<p>The next course of action is to establish my specific field of interest when it comes to sickle cell research. Many advances have been made so far when it comes to preventing and reducing the effect of sickle cell, such as gene therapy, gene editing, bone marrow transplant, hydroxyurea treatment, switching on of the fetal haemoglobin gene(HbF), among others. However, the reality is that many issues arise with such interventions, including the high cost of treatment and lack of easy access to such treatments, unwanted health complications such as random gene mutations, and lack of many quality heath and research centres dedicated to combatting this disease. I intend to focus my research in research and translational science, which involves practically applying fundamental scientific discoveries made about sickle cell. I intend to use my understanding of molecular biology in applying therapeutic treatments that can reduce, and even nullify, the effects of this disease. This work involves assessing, monitoring, and evaluating the effectiveness, safety, and cost of these treatments among sickle cell patients.</p>
<p>I hope to make further contributions by exploring ways and means within the field of pharmacology that are cost-effective and easily accessible to those in need of treatment, and with a very high proven success rate, and also by researching on the way certain genes influence response to drugs among individuals within the Sub-Sarahan population, coming up with the right dosages and ways to implement optimum dosages, and reconfiguring the use of certain drugs and their effects through drug repurposing. Furthermore, I am determined to improve upon already existing solutions to the frequent crises sickle cell patients go through, as well as the risks they face, such as inflammation and damage to the spleen. With these research advancements and contributions, I believe that significant progress would have been made in reducing the prevalence of sickle cell as continuous and highly valued efforts into coming up with a potential cure continues.</p>
<p>However, achieving all this will definitely not be anything close to easy. Securing adequate funding and lack of suitable modern infrastructure are just a few of the challenges I expect to encounter, and these can be reasons for people to give up on such a mission. Nonetheless, I see these challenges as stepping stones and opportunities to rise above adversity, put renewed faith in God, seek clarity, and act in accordance to what is right in the eyes of both God and humanity. The world needs such minds, and I am sure that is definitely something I will learn at Mercer University.</p></div> 

<div class="portfolio-item">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, the future is radiant with an unending determination to achieve greater heights. This mission is one that must be treated with the highest amount of discipline, consistency, reverence, and service. I believe that being a Stamps Scholar and an Honors student will work wonders in fulfilling my mission to not only bring about an effective treatment for diseases such as sickle cell, but also in being a leader everywhere I go and inspiring others to fulfill whatever lies dear to their hearts.</p> </div>
